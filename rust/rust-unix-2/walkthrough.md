The [`exa`](https://the.exa.website/) tool, written in Rust, is intended to be a
modern replacement for `ls`. It enables many sensible defaults like colours for
different file types and provides additional features that `ls`
doesnt&mdash;like viewing the git status of files in the current directory. It's
just as easy to use as `ls`!
