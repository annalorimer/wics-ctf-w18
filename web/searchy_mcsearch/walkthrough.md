This is an SQL Injection challenge. 

1. You want to try to guess how the sql statement is formed in the backend. 
2. Try putting characters that would cause an SQL error statement or enter the recommended searches to get a hint that the backend is talking to a DB.
3. Entering 'or 1=1;--' will dump the DB and give the flag.
